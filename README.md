# E-ZPassFL


## Description


E-ZPassFL is a small React-based demo app modeled around simple expense tracking and receipt display for a fictional "E-ZPass Florida" utility. The app demonstrates component-driven front-end structure, state handling for form inputs, basic list management for expenses/receipts, and a minimal responsive layout suitable for expansion. It is designed for students and developers who want a clean example of building a lightweight React UI with separate components, clear CSS modules, and test scaffolding. The repository offers a ready-to-run setup with instructions to clone, install dependencies, and start the dev server. (200 words)
